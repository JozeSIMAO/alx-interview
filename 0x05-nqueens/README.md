# BACKTRACKING

- Backtracking is a problem-solving technique used in computer science and mathematics to find solutions incrementally by exploring all possible options. It is particularly useful for solving problems where a sequence of choices needs to be made, such as constraint satisfaction problems, combinatorial optimization problems, and puzzles.

In backtracking, the algorithm begins by making choices and exploring potential solutions. If the current choice leads to a dead end (i.e., it violates some constraint or cannot lead to a valid solution), the algorithm backtracks and tries another option. This process continues recursively until a solution is found or all possible options have been explored.

Here's a general outline of how backtracking works:

1. Choose: Make a choice from the  available options.
3. Explore: Move forward with the chosen option.
4. Check: Determine if the chosen option is a valid solution.
5. Recurse: If the option is valid, recursively explore further choices.
6. Backtrack: If a dead end is reached or the chosen option does not lead to a valid solution, backtrack to the previous decision point and try another option.
Backtracking is commonly implemented using recursion. Each recursive call represents a decision point, and the algorithm explores different branches of the decision tree until a solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

Backtracking is often more efficient than brute-force approaches because it prunes the search space by eliminating branches that cannot lead to a solution. However, the efficiency of backtracking algorithms heavily depends on the problem being solved and the constraints involved.
